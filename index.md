These are notes have been compiled from the posts on the Dhamma Study Group [https://groups.io/g/dsg](https://groups.io/g/dsg) mostly by Sarah Abbott. Many are from discussions with Ajahn Sujin Boriharnwanket. These notes are unedited arnd may contain many PƒÅli words. They are mostly abstruse points about the teaching and generally not suitable for the beginner.

The Dhamma Study Group is  a discussion forum for anyone interested in understanding the Buddha's teachings. The aim of the discussions is to support the development of understanding of life as taught by the Buddha. Anyone having an interest is welcome to join.  No prior knowledge of Buddhism is required.
