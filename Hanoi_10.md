# Sarah's notes from Hanoi 10

**Dear Friend**

1. Before dreaming, there must be many moments of nimitta of sense experiences conditioning the story. (The same now when day-dreaming.)

2. Qu about raising worms for chickens. Different cittas but killing is killing no matter the situation, when wanting other creatures to die, taking action and death occurring. Cetan훮 is kamma patha just when it brings results. Killing is so dangerous. Who doesn't kill? Only understanding reality can condition more and more kusala.

3.  Qu about being a butcher. Is killing a butcher or a soldier or anyone else? It's a reality which can condition results, kamma and vip훮ka. There is no one, just strong akusala. We think about this and that, but what about the slight akusala now? Without the little ones, there cannot be the strong ones later. It seems OK when it's only a little akusala, but it should be understood no matter at what level. As long as there is no understanding of reality, there must always be akusala arising. Even a very little understanding now is better than none.

4. Vegetarianism. Someone had seen a video of killing. Killing is not eating. The Buddha was not a vegetarian, so what's the purpose? A monk cannot be vegetarian. What's the purpose of being a monk? The monks eat food to support life, just enough to get rid of the hungry feeling. Attachment to not eating meat, not understanding what food is for. Devadatta wanted to ban eating of meat. Wrong view! Meat is "pure" when neither seen, heard or suspected to have been killed for oneself.

5. Qu about meditating and "bringing back the mind" and overcoming sadness. Who is practicing?
Meditating can be for other purposes but not for understanding. The aim of the Buddha's Teachings is to eradicate all defilements perfectly. Different from other words. When there are conditions for attachment and sadness, they must arise.

6. Qu about Mahayana and Therav훮da, various rules, chanting, diet and so on when family visit. "The truth is the truth - not 'Mayayana' or 'Theravada'" No need to think about such terms.

7. S카la, the behaviour of cittas. Are they to 'keep' or to understand? Are the cittas different now from moment to moment? So many rules because of the different behaviour in cittas. When there is no understanding, citta is taken for self, so there is the idea of 'I am observing rules". Understanding is not 'I". The Buddha taught about all levels of kusala and akusala. The Buddha taught about the danger of all kinds of akusala, especially the strong ones like killing. When it is more dangerous, it harms others. When we read the Vinaya, we can follow many of the rules. What is good is not limited to anyone. It depends on understanding.
